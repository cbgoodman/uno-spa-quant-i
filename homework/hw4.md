#### Time Series Estimation – Phillips Curve

Use the ```phillips.dta``` data for this homework assignment

1. 	Using the data estimate an expectations augmented Phillips curve (<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\Delta&space;inf_t&space;=&space;\beta_0&space;&plus;&space;\beta_1&space;unem_t&space;&plus;&space;e_t" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\Delta&space;inf_t&space;=&space;\beta_0&space;&plus;&space;\beta_1&space;unem_t&space;&plus;&space;e_t" title="\Delta inf_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 unem_t + e_t" /></a> ). Estimate separate specifications that include linear, and linear + quadratic trend. (You’ll end up with three regressions).
2. Describe and test (where appropriate) to ensure that all of the time series assumptions for the model are correct.
3. Estimate a static Phillips curve using the Prais-Winsten estimator. Discuss the results as they relate to your results from part 1
